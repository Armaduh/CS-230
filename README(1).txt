The Gaming Room is a company that is hosting a game called Draw it or Lose it. They asked for the game to be playable on a variety of operating systems. In order to do this we must make a program that works alongside other operating systems when communicating with the server. I did not develop this project well as my wisdom tooth sears most nights and I roll in bed, unable to focus on a screen. I would have gone through the code to make sure any redundancies were removed. I would revise the learning of multiple instances of players all happening at once. The process of connecting multiple clients to a single server on one time is major. To better suit the users needs, the simplification of code to speed up memory and storage, hosting on Linux and running docker containers helped make the game run at peak performance. In order to approach this game, the next attempt would be done in either Unreal Engine orwith pre-existing modules. The process of making a game is much easier on these programs with non-copyright, preset tools for customization. Web development and server management is a task much better suited for eclipse and VSC, whereas tools Unity engine and Unreal engine are better for games of any kind.
